# A simple neural network
- _an implementation of a simple neural network_     
- _done in Python and Numpy, with no external machine learning framework used_ 
- understanding spam classification   



The purpose of this project was to understand the full architecture of a neural network and to visually break down what's going on while training to recognize spam messages/emails. 

#### DONE:

###### Setting up:    
- [x] execute command `ipython notebook` from commandline in the same folder as `NeuralNetwork-SpamClassification.ipynb`
- [x] when the broswer is open launch `NeuralNetwork-SpamClassification.ipynb`
 

###### Training:    
- run the cell segments in the vertical order


#### FURTHER IDEAS:
- coming soon
